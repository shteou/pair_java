A company (PayBetter ltd) offers a service called Crosspay, that allows cross countries payments. A commission fee will be applied on each payment, based on the payer's currency.

At the moment the Crosspay service is available for 3 currencies. Below are the currencies the service can be used with, and the correspondent commission fee:

USD: 0.5%

GBP: 0.25%

EUR: 0.75%

You're requested to implement a java application that takes an array of payments (see ./input.txt) and and returns an array of payments containing the commission fee for each payment (see ./output.txt). The solution has to be developed following a TDD approach.
